    "title": "Hear From One of the Lives We Support",
    "subtitle": "Manager, Sainte Marie Mother of God Orphanage – Mugera",
    "paragraphs": {
      "p1": "The Sainte Marie Mother of God Orphanage was founded in 1946 by Miss Rosa Nyanzira. Its mission was to rescue completely destitute children — orphans, abandoned children, and those whose parents were disabled or suffering from mental illness. She welcomed children from all backgrounds without discrimination.",
      "p2": "Later, Mama Nestor Nzisabira joined her. They worked together for many years. Mama Nestor later founded the Congregation of the Sisters of Sainte Bernadette, who helped care for the children alongside Miss Rosa.",
      "p3": "Miss Rosa faced many hardships, especially a lack of food. She would take the children to church to pray, and then to a nearby mountain called \"Lourdes\" in Mugera to ask Jesus and Mary for food. Provision would always follow.",
      "p4": "The parish once provided land to cultivate and support the orphanage. Today, due to economic hardship, that support has greatly reduced. We now receive only minimal assistance from local movements.",
      "p5": "The house is divided into a dormitory and living space for girls, and a separate dormitory for boys. We live through divine mercy and the generosity of benefactors chosen by the Lord — like ASCA.",
      "p6": "From the beginning, our way of surviving has been to send children to school so they may have a better future. We also teach them to cultivate, to care for animals, and to pray for those who help them.",
      "p7": "We raise small livestock — chickens, rabbits, and goats — to provide occasional meat and manure for our crops. We had hoped to acquire larger livestock, but the cost is too high. Even a young bull costs more than 1 million Burundian francs.",
      "p8": "I conclude by thanking you from the bottom of my heart for the effort you make and the love you show us continually. May God bless and strengthen you."

    "intro": "Many children face barriers that go beyond the classroom — challenges that quietly shape their future long before they have the chance to choose it.",
    "paragraphs": {
      "p1": "For some children, school becomes difficult not because they lack potential, but because poverty creates constant uncertainty. When families struggle to afford meals, uniforms, or basic supplies, education can slowly slip out of reach.",
      "p2": "Malnutrition affects more than physical health — it impacts concentration, confidence, and long-term development. A hungry child cannot fully focus on learning or participate with the same energy as their peers.",
      "p3": "Isolation and emotional distress often follow loss or hardship. Children who experience bereavement, displacement, or social exclusion may withdraw, carrying emotional burdens that shape how they see themselves and the world.",
      "p4": "These challenges are interconnected. School dropout, poverty, hunger, and emotional strain rarely exist alone. To create lasting change, support must address the whole child — academically, socially, and emotionally."

  "text": "Created on July 30, 2023, by a group of Benedictine Secular Oblates belonging to the Third Benedictine Order of the Abbey of Clervaux, the Association believes that helping an orphaned, poor, or abandoned child is like saving humanity for a better world.\n\nPoverty is unjust. ASCA is committed to not leaving behind children living in extreme hardship, providing them with the support they need to pursue a fulfilling education and have enough to eat.\n\nSaint Carlo Acutis, the patron of our association, serves as a model for generosity and compassion toward the most vulnerable, the poorest of the poor."
